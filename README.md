# Sparse Polynomial Multiplication
Two sparse polynomials are multiplied by this simple programme. Since I am using two polynomials, this programme lacks any form of function declaration or definition. If your use case involves more than two polynomials, additional functions can be added to read, display, and multiply these polynomials.
